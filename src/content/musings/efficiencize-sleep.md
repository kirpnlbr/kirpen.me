It’s no secret that the shorter you sleep, the shorter your life span.

Routinely sleeping less than eight hours a night severely cleaves our immune systems. With the potentiality of binated cancer risk too.

But as students with regularly large volumes of work, trying to sleep efficiently is like grasping at straws—it’s almost always in vain. Nevertheless, there are still ways to increase our sleep efficiency scores and improve the quality of our zzz’s by following these insights backed by the science of sleep:

1.	Expose yourself to sunlight regularly
If you find yourself still wide awake in the middle of the night with no signs of torpor or drowsiness, most likely your internal body clock’s inaccurate, like a wristwatch’s side-dials pointing at the wrong time. 
To “wind” our body clocks back precisely to the right time, exposing yourself to sunlight in the morning does the job. Sunlight acts as the manipulating finger and thumb in our imprecise wristwatches because our body clocks respond to light as a signal to be awake, and vice versa when it’s dark.

2.	Avoid drinking coffee after 2 p.m.
A chemical substance called adenosine builds up in our brains all day long that creates sleep pressure. As the day progresses, so does the pressure. But every time we drink coffee, caffeine mums that pressure by blocking adenosine’s path to the brain.
The catch, however, is that by the time the caffeine wears off—it invariably leads to a caffeine crash. To avoid the lethargy-inducing consequence, steer clear from consuming coffee after 2 p.m. since caffeine lasts for 4-6 or 5-7 hours.

3.	Sleep for 30-to-60 minutes at noon
Genetically, humans are designed for biphasic sleep, aka sleeping twice a day. It’s the reason why during the so-called “golden hour” of 1 p.m. onwards that we get sleepy. When we’re forfeited of this innate practice of biphasic sleep, our lives are shortened. Napping for 30-to-60-minutes in the afternoon should be enough to efficiencize our sleep habits.

4.	Calculate when you should wake up
Across the night, we alternate between NREM and REM sleep in 90-minute intervals. NREM sleep strengthens individual memories while weeding out unnecessary neural connections, while REM sleep blends those connections in highly abstract and novel ways. Waking up at the middle of a stage disrupts the formation of these connections and ultimately damages our brains.
The good news is that you can calculate the optimal time when you should wake up through a sleep calculator such as https://sleepcalculator.com/. Following the time these calculators suggest will allow you to rise in between your 90-minute sleep cycles—you’ll never wake up feeling hit by a truck ever again.
